# Birth Weight Preduction using Model Selection, Regularized Regression

## Overview 
This project involves model fitting, model comparison, z-standardization, and regularized (L2) regression using the kaiser.csv dataset from the Child Health and Development Studies. 
The goal is to predict the birth weight of babies and analyze the occurrence of complications in the first 3 months of pregnancy. 

## Dataset Description
The kaiser.csv file contains the following variables:

- age: Age of the mom at the time of birth.
- smoke: Indicates whether the mom is a smoker or non-smoker.
- hospital: Hospital where the birth took place (Oakland, SanFrancisco, WalnutCreek, SanJose, Richmond).
- gestation: Gestation period (length of pregnancy) in days.
- parity: Indicates if the child is the first born (1) or has older siblings (0).
- weight: Weight of the baby in pounds.
- complication: Indicates if there was a complication within the first 3 months of pregnancy (0: No, 1: Yes).

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The required version is Python 3.7 or later. You also need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
